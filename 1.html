  <p style="margin-top:45px;">
A hacker is a person skilled in 
information technology who uses 
their technical knowledge to achieve 
a goal or overcome an obstacle, 
within a computerized system by
non-standard means. Though the term 
hacker has become associated in 
popular culture with a security 
hacker - someone who utilizes their 
technical know-how of bugs or 
exploits to break into computer 
systems and access data which would 
otherwise be inaccessible to them â€“ 
hacking can also be utilized by 
legitimate figures in legal situations.
For example, law enforcement agencies 
sometimes use hacking techniques in 
order to collect evidence on criminals 
and other malicious actors. This could
 include using anonymity tools (such 
 as a VPN, or the dark web) to mask 
 their identities online, posing as 
 criminals themselves. Likewise, 
 covert world agencies can employ 
 hacking techniques in the legal 
 conduct of their work. On the other 
 hand, hacking and cyber-attacks are 
 used extra- and illegally by law 
 enforcement and security agencies 
 (conducting warrantless activities),
  and employed by state actors as a 
  weapon of both legal and illegal 
  warfare.
